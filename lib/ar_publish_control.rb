  # This is a gem version of http://github.com/avdgaag/acts_as_publishable ( a Rails plugin)
  # Thanks to Avdaag for his awesome, super readable code which I ripped off for this gem.
  #
  # Specify this act if you want to show or hide your object based on date/time settings. This act lets you
  # specify two dates two form a range in which the model is publicly available; it is unavailable outside it.
  # 
  # == Usage
  # 
  # You can add this behaviour to your model like so:
  # 
  #   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     publish_control
  #   end
  # 
  # Then you can use it as follows:
  # 
  #   post = Post.create(:title => 'Hello world')
  #   post.published? # => true
  #   
  #   post.publish!
  #   post.published? # => true
  #   
  #   post.unpublish!
  #   post.published? # => false
  #   
  # You can use two named_scopes to find the published or unpublished objects.
  # You can chain them with other scopes and use them on association collections:
  #   
  #   Post.all.count          # => 15
  #   Post.published.count    # => 10
  #   Post.unpublished.count  # => 5 includes upcoming and expired
  #   Post.draft.count        # => where is_published == false regardless of date
  #   @post.comments.published
  #
  #   Post.recent.published
  #
  #  Klass.unpublished includes all objects which is_published flag is set to false and/or are expired or upcoming.
  #  If you specifically want those where is_published == false regardless of dates, use Klass.draft
  # 
  # There's a third named_scope that you can pass a boolean in order to find only published items or all of them
  # This is useful in controller for permission-based publish control
  #
  #   @post       = Post.published.find(params[:id])
  #   @comments   = @post.comments.only_published( logged_in? )
  # 
  # Available statuses. This constant is useful for autogenerated routes, controller actions and view helpers
  #
  STATUSES = [:published, :draft, :upcoming, :expired]

      # == Configuration options
      #
      # Right now this plugin has only one configuration option. Models with no publication dates
      # are by default published, not unpublished. If you want to hide your model when it has no
      # explicit publication date set, you can turn off this behaviour with the
      # +publish_by_default+ (defaults to <tt>true</tt>) option like so:
      #
      #   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     publish_control :publish_by_default => false
      #   end
      #
      # == Database Schema
      #
      # The model that you're publishing needs to have two special date attributes:
      # 
      # * publish_at
      # * unpublish_at
      # 
      # These attributes have no further requirements or required validations; they
      # just need to be <tt>datetime</tt>-columns.
      # 
      # You can use a migration like this to add these columns to your model:
      #
      #   class AddPublicationDatesToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
      #     def self.up
      #       add_column :posts, :publish_at, :datetime
      #       add_column :posts, :unpublish_at, :datetime
      #     end
      #   
      #     def self.down
      #       remove_column :posts, :publish_at
      #       remove_column :posts, :unpublish_at
      #     end
      #   end
      # 
      def publish_control(options = { :publish_by_default => true })
        # don't allow multiple calls
